# Introduction to DevOps: What It Is and Why It Matters
DevOps is a methodology that brings two teams together : Development and Operations. Basically it focuses on Collaboration, Communication and Integration between the two teams. It enables faster and more reliable software releases, while also improving the overall quality and efficiency of the software development process.

If we look at the history of software industry, development and operations team have worked in isolation from each other with little collaboration and communication. Developers were responsible for writing code, while operations teams were responsible for deploying and maintaining that code in production environments. This approach often led to lengthy development cycles, frequent errors and bugs, and a lack of accountability for issues that arose during the deployment process.

DevOps seeks to overcome these challenges by bringing development and operations teams together into a single, collaborative team.

# One Key Note

While the word "DevOps" is a combination of Dev and Ops , it doesn't mean that it leaves out other teams.
Dev is usually meant to include everyone from Code side, like:
- Developers
- Front End Designers
- QA Engineers

While Ops is meant to include traditionally everyone from the System side, like:
- System Admins
- Network Admins
- Database Admins


# Why it matters
It has been shown that following DevOps practices fastens the pase of software development, changes and releases.
The Puppet Lab's State of DevOps survey shows that teams following DevOps Practices
- Deployed changes 30 times more frequently
- Had 200 time shorter lead times
- Faced 60 times fewer failures
- Recovered from errors 168 times faster 
than teams who don't follow DevOps practices.

Was that enough motivation? 
Well DevOps offer many social and psychological benefits as well:-

- It reduces unplanned works
- It increases friendly relationships between coworkers
- It reduces stress on the job


# What DevOps is not ?
While talking about DevOps, it is necessary to mitigate some miths about DevOps, like:
- DevOps is a new name for Operations Team
- It is just a fancy job title
- It is a new tool (or set of tools)

# What is DevOps ?
DevOps is actually a lifestyle. While companies from IBM to Microsoft talk about DevOps, there is no single agreed apon definition. Still, we can talk about 5 levels of DevOps:
- Values
- Principles
- Methods
- Practices
- Tools
